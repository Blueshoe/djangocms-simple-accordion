Customization

You can just override some of the CSS rules. In order to find the correct one, nspect the generated HTML in the development tools in the browser of your choice.

However, here are some commonly used customization options to get you started:

**Tab-Icons**

.. code-block:: css

    .accordion-title .accordion-toggleIcon:after {
      font-size: 13px;
      content: '\e080';
    }
    .accordion-title.active .accordion-toggleIcon:after {
      content: '\e114';
    }

**Accordion Color**

.. code-block:: css

    .accordion {
      background-color: red;
    }

**Title font size**

.. code-block:: css

    .accordion-title {
      font-size: 20px;
    }

**Transition Time**

.. code-block:: css

    .u-accordion-transition {
      -webkit-transition: ease-in-out .2s;
      -moz-transition: ease-in-out .2s;
      -ms-transition: ease-in-out .2s;
      -o-transition: ease-in-out .2s;
      transition: ease-in-out .2s;
    }

If you feel like you need to customize the plugin more than what is easily possible with CSS, go ahead and copy the directory *djangocms_accordion* into your django project.
